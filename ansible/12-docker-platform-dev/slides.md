To dev with ansible :

		* have some VM

		* VM must be drop and recreate easily > container

		* have systemd into your VM (start/stop service, simulate a VM)

		* have your ssh key into VM

		* instantiate it quickly

<br>

Use docker container :
		
		* image with systemd

		* image with ssh server

		* run quickly many containers (with a script)

		* add your key into the container (not into the image)

<br>

>> you with an image and a script
